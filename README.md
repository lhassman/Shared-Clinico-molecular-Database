# Shared-Clinico-molecular-Database
Brainstorming on how to create a forum for sharing de-identified clinical and molecular data in order develop a precision-medicine approach to uveitis.

I'm a clinician-scientist at WashU interested in improving care of my patients with uveitis. Because uveitis is fairly rare (100/100,000 US adults) and no patient with uveitis is exacly like another, we don't always know what the best treatment for an individual patient will be. Therefore, we try a therapy that we think will work, but sometimes end up having to switch to something different. I think we can and should do better for our patients! We need lots of data in order to do good research on which treatments are best, but because no doctor or institution has enough patients to make really strong conclusions, we need to be able to share data across institutions and medical practices. To do that we need a large database that contains clinical information, as well as information from biomedical assays. Challenges to this data-sharing include protecting patient privacy and extracting good information from electronic medical records.
